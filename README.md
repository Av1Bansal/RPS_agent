This repository also includes a script to simulate a 1000-episode match between `my_agent` and a `random_agent` and generate performance visualizations.

### Running the Analysis

To run the simulation, ensure you have installed all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python analysis.py
